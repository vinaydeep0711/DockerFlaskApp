This is a Simple REST based flask API just for learning purpose

With this App Lets also understand few of the important REST principles-

REST- REPRESENTAL STATE TRANSFER
It is a way thinking how a web server behaves or responds to your request
- It doest't respond with just data
- It responds with resource 
-REST is stateless - one request can not depend on any other request
-Server only knows about the current request, and not any previous request

REST METHODS:
GET/
POST/
PUT/
DELETE/
